### Properties

#### Core Properties

-   **id**: A unique identifier for the entity. This is required for distinguishing entities within the system.
    
-   **projectId**: Identifies the project to which the entity belongs.

-   **referenceId**: If the entity is integrated on top of existing data, this field references the original item’s ID in your system. It can also accept static values (e.g., "about-page" for static content).
    
-   **shortId**: An automatically generated, unique identifier that can be used for creating sharing links.
    

#### User and Content

-   **user**: Contains basic user information for the creator of the entity. This field might be null, as not all entities are necessarily created by users (e.g., static entities like "home-page").
    
-   **title**: The title of the entity. Nullable.
    
-   **content**: The main content of the entity. Nullable.
    
-   **mentions**: An array of `Mention` objects, representing users mentioned within the content. Each `Mention` object includes a user’s ID and username.
    

#### Media and Tags

-   **media**: An array of JSON objects holding information about media items attached to the entity. Developers can define any structure for these objects. For example, they might include fields like `url` (an external URL where the media is stored), `size`, or `format`, but these are only examples and not required.
    
-   **keywords**: An array of keywords or tags associated with the entity. Useful for filtering feeds or searches.
    

#### Votes and Interactions

-   **upvotes**: An array of user IDs representing users who upvoted the entity.
    
-   **downvotes**: An array of user IDs representing users who downvoted the entity.
    
-   **repliesCount**: The total number of comments and replies associated with the entity (merged count).
    

#### Analytics and Scoring

-   **views**: The total number of views the entity has received. Needs to be dynamivally increased by the developer.
    
-   **score**: A "hotness" score for the entity, automatically generated based on user activity.
    
-   **scoreUpdatedAt**: The timestamp of the last score update.
    

#### Location and Metadata

-   **location**: An optional property for storing the location of the entity as a GeoJSON point. For example, this could represent the location of a hotel listing. It includes:
    
    -   **type**: Always set to "Point".
    -   **coordinates**: An array containing [longitude, latitude].
-   **metadata**: A JSON object for storing additional data about the entity that is relevant to the project. Limited to 10KB in size.
    

#### Top Comment

-   **topComment**: If the entity has at least one comment, this field will hold the data for the top comment. Otherwise, it remains null.

#### Timestamps

-   **createdAt**: The timestamp for when the entity was created.
    
-   **updatedAt**: The timestamp for the most recent update to the entity.
    
-   **deletedAt**: The timestamp for when the entity was deleted, if applicable. Otherwise, it is null.

### Flexibility for Integration

The `Entity` object is designed to be flexible. Developers can wrap entities around existing data without altering the original dataset. This feature ensures Replyke can be integrated seamlessly into projects with pre-existing data structures, making it easier to adopt Replyke’s features without significant changes to the underlying system.
